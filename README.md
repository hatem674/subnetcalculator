🔥 Extra Tip
If you want I can also generate a cool badge set (like "Built with Python", "Streamlit app", etc.) to make the README even more beautiful!
Want me to add that too? 🎯🚀

Would you also like a ready .gitignore to ignore .pyc files, .DS_Store, and .venv if you are planning to upload everything? 📁👨‍💻
